# Discord message bot
## Instructions
Change the specific parameters like channel_id, etc. 

Use a search engine to find out your session token of your discord account. DonÂ´t share this token to other partys! Everyone who have this token can takeover your account.

Also I used for the user-agent a widely spread user agent. You can change this to a specific one if you prefer.

## Adding multiple messages

If you need to send more different messages you can add more ```main("Your message!")``` with a specific sleep timer like ```sleep(60)``` for 60 seconds.
